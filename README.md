My multi-webhook spammer now made in Go with a simple UI!

# Features

- Manual Input
  - Paste in multiple webhooks in a textbox and press <kbd>CTRL+S</kbd> to start spamming.
- Load from file
  - Load many webhooks from a file, each separated with a newline.
- Live webhook status and info display
  - Shows the status of the current webhooks with colors:
    - ðŸ”´ deleted/invalid
    - ðŸŸ£ ratelimited
    - ðŸŸ¢ valid and alive

## TODO

- [ ] Dynamic alignment
- [x] Spam Message customization

## Known bugs

- Webhooks are only stacked horizontally, will overflow if the window size is too small
